    "2. Unroll `a_C` and `a_G` as explained in the picture above\n",
    "    - You'll likely want to use these functions: [tf.transpose](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/transpose) and [tf.reshape](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reshape).\n",
    "3. Compute the content cost:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Additional Hints for \"Unrolling\"\n",
    "* To unroll the tensor, you want the shape to change from $(m,n_H,n_W,n_C)$ to $(m, n_H \\times n_W, n_C)$.\n",
    "* `tf.reshape(tensor, shape)` takes a list of integers that represent the desired output shape.\n",
    "* For the `shape` parameter, a `-1` tells the function to choose the correct dimension size so that the output tensor still contains all the values of the original tensor.\n",
    "* So `tf.reshape(a_C, shape=[m, n_H * n_W, n_C])` gives the same result as `tf.reshape(a_C, shape=[m, -1, n_C])`.\n",
    "* If you prefer to re-order the dimensions, you can use `tf.transpose(tensor, perm)`, where `perm` is a list of integers containing the original index of the dimensions. \n",
    "* For example, `tf.transpose(a_C, perm=[0,3,1,2])` changes the dimensions from $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$ to $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$.\n",
    "<!-- * There is more than one way you can unroll a tensor.  -->\n",
    "* Again, note that you don't necessarily need `tf.transpose` to 'unroll' the tensors in this case but this is a useful function to practice and understand for other situations that you'll encounter.\n"

    "Great job on completing this assignment! You are now able to use Neural Style Transfer to generate artistic images. This is also your first time building a model in which the optimization algorithm updates the pixel values rather than the neural network's parameters. Deep learning has many different types of models and this is only one of them! \n",

    "## What you should remember\n",
    "- Neural Style Transfer is an algorithm that given a content image C and a style image S can generate an artistic image\n",
    "- It uses representations (hidden layer activations) based on a pretrained ConvNet. \n",
    "- The content cost function is computed using one hidden layer's activations.\n",
    "- The style cost function for one layer is computed using the Gram matrix of that layer's activations. The overall style cost function is obtained using several hidden layers.\n",
    "- Optimizing the total cost function results in synthesizing new images. \n",
